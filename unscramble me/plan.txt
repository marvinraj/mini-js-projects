da plan 

1. lay out the structure with html only
2. start js (logic) : 
    - get elements from html that changes
    - store words and clues in an array of objects
    - create a start game function
        -- select a word randomly from the array
        -- shuffle the letters in the word
        -- render the shuffled letters, score and chances into html
    - create a function to check lose (player guess wrong)
        - decrease chances
    - create a function to check win (player guess correct) 
        - increase score
    - create function to check lose game entirely (chances = 0)
        - send alert saying "loser noob" and restart game
    - create a function to check score once player guesses all 10 words
        - display alert - show score and restart game
