da plan 

1. lay out the structure with html only
2. start js : 
    - display word but each letter should be able to be targeted
    - display scrambled word
    - display score and wrong for current word
    - user types in word
        -- wrong answer - display 'wrong answer' & increase wrong count by 1
            -- guessed wrong 3 times - lose, restart game
        -- correct answer - increase the score & change to next word
            -- all words guessed, go back to q1, score resets to 0
